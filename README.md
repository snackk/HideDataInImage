# HideDataInImage

## Overview

This is a Steganography Tool, that hides data into an image, using the Least Significant Bit Algorithm(LSB).
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

A jpeg image is composed by 3 channels, RGB, each have 8-bit density, that mean it has 2^8 (256) possible values per channel. In computing, the least significant bit (LSB) is the bit position in a binary integer giving the units value, that is, determining whether the number is even or odd. The LSB is sometimes referred to as the right-most bit, due to the convention in positional notation of writing less significant digits further to the right. So if we could apply this to a image, we could possibly store data without it being seen by a human eye.
